## Sun | Aries 100% <a name='sun'></a>

You can be inspirational, courageous, enthusiastic, original, independent, impatient, aggressive, headstrong, selfish, self-centered, and impulsive. Your energies are directed toward building a new individuality, thus all your energies are directed towards yourself and what you want. 

You likes roles where your leadership abilities are put on display. You have executive and organizing ability which is mainly directed in starting things. Sustaining projects is not your strength, but initiating projects is. The tendency to "damn the torpedoes" and ram full-speed ahead must be controlled. You are capable of great accomplishments if you learn how to constructively use your abundant energies. 

You are naturally enthusiastic and are always ready for activity and competition. You are inspiring to others because of these tendencies. Ideas and creative projects seem to flow from you in a never-ending stream.  You are full of energy and never lack courage.

Because you can be pretty self-centered, you must remember that other people may have good ideas and can assume responsibility and leadership roles, too. Your natural tendency is to stand alone and do everything yourself. But cooperation with others can be very effective in getting things done to the end rather than simply starting things and quitting before completion. You have a tendency to start a project, then to suddenly lose interest in it if progress is too slow or things have become too complicated.

You are an assertive and freedom-loving individual. You have a strong need for independence, and may tend to display self-concern assertively.

You are very straight-forward and are neither subtle nor devious. You say what's on your mind and you pull no punches. You don't hold grudges and although you can get quite angry, you do not hold it in and stew about what bothers you. You blow in and out like some great Midwestern thunderstorm. It may be violent while it lasts, but it is usually over quickly.

You are prone to headaches due to tension. You are usually aggressive in relationships and generally take the lead. You go after what interests you and the chase may be more fun for you than the conquest.

Four things you should learn are patience, conservation of energy, completion, and control of temper.


## Ascendant | Leo 38.7% <a name='ascendant-in-leo'></a>

You can be generous, proud, emotional, romantic, extroverted, vain, egotistical, courageous, sentimental, self-confident, showy, and want to shine and be successful in wherever you go and whatever you do. You like to "rule" and have homage paid to you for your "royal" nature. 

You like to take risks and can sometimes be foolhardy, but you definitely have a zest for living. Life is best viewed as a grand creative project. Your self-expression is powerful, warm, sunny and enthusiastic. You are generous and fun-loving and enjoy being the center of attention.

The worst thing someone can do to you is to hurt your pride or be unappreciative of you. You wear your heart on your sleeve in matters of love and you need a partner you can be proud of – and you want them to be proud of you. 

You are faithful to and protective of those you love. You can be quick-tempered, but you tend to not stay angry for long. You like to play the kingly role and have a sense of drama surrounding you. You are a ham. You like being the center of attention and will do things just to get that attention. 

You can be stubborn in a sunny sort of way. Your roar is worse than your bite. If your pride is hurt or your dignity is trampled on, then watch out, because you can forgive, but you don't forget. You enjoy sports and out-of-doors activity. Your vitality and spirit are strong except if your heart is broken in love. Your need for love and affection is very great and you need to feel appreciated. If frustrated, you lose your desire for living.

Spiritual lesson to learn: Humility.
 The Sun rules Leo, so the Sun will be important in your chart, including its house position. See its house position below, in the section titled "Planets and Points in the Houses," if you entered your birth time.


## Ascendant | Cancer 38.1% <a name='ascendant-in-cancer'></a>

People with Cancer rising tend to be less vital than average, having periods of low energy. They are sympathetic, compassionate, passive, nurturing, receptive, protective, retentive, changeable, psychic, sentimental, tenacious, timid, quiet, sensitive, acquisitive (pack-rat), and moody. 

Just like the crab Cancer represents, you may have the habit of looking ahead and behind you at the same time, not fully wanting to face the future head-on and always worrying about the past and what might be sneaking up on you from behind, causing you great worry. You go through life in a curious sideways motion, never going simply directly forward.

You are sensitive and you retreat into your shell when you feel threatened. You can build a protective wall if you feel vulnerable. Your feelings can be easily hurt even when no slight was meant, and you can take things much too personally. 

You enjoy travel, but you absolutely need to know that you have a home base waiting for you to come back to. Security is everything for you in life. Physical security comes with a comfortable base of operations and emotional security comes from all your possessions and attachments that have sentimental value to you. In fact, that's why you keep everything – because of all the emotional value and significance.

Once you have latched onto something or someone, you do not tend to let go easily. You respond to life through feeling, not thinking. Your moods go up and down just like the tides.

Caring for others provides your key for self-expression. Life can also be met with strong internalized emotions and a tenacious regard for family and tradition.


Spiritual lesson to learn: Discernment (distinguish boundaries).
 The Moon rules Cancer, so the Moon will be important in your chart, including its house position. See its house position below, in the section titled "Planets and Points in the Houses," if you entered your birth time.


## Ascendant | Virgo 18% <a name='ascendant-in-virgo'></a>

People with Virgo rising tend to be practical, analytical, discriminating, fastidious, careful, exacting, attentive to details, methodical, quiet, unassuming, shy, critical, thoughtful, and somewhat self-centered. You have an ingenious, active and alert mind. Gaining knowledge and putting it to good use are important to you. 

Order and precision are your preferred modes of self-expression. You will develop a strong critical nature and a need for perfection. Other people will appreciate your practical approach to daily problems.

However, your strive for perfection can make you quite the person to live with or to be around because your standards for yourself and others are so high. At times others can never be "good" enough to meet those high standards. Finding what's wrong with things is your forte. 

Sometimes, though, this can make relationships sour as you often turn your critical eye on the one you love and the things they do. Pessimism and being too self-critical are two faults you should try to improve upon. You may tend to worry too much, especially about the small stuff, the little details. Too much worry can lead to health problems. 

You need to learn to digest every experience and assimilate it without bitterness, regret, spite or resentment. You need to get rid of any negativity that stems from a feeling of inadequacy. You tend to look younger than you really are, no matter what your age. You are very restless and nervous, so you seldom have much weight on you. At times you can be very indecisive and unsure.


Spiritual lesson to learn: Service.

## Ascendant | Gemini 5% <a name='ascendant-in-gemini'></a>

You tend to be friendly, communicative, flexible, indecisive, unsure, liking to do two or more things at once, witty, clever, very active mentally, high-strung, temperamental, nervous or anxious, talkative, superficial, and always ready for something different. 

There may be two distinct sides to you as Gemini represents the Twins. You have a strong need to communicate what you already know and to learn more. You enjoy reading and traveling as they both give plenty of scope for picking up new knowledge. 

You need variety and can be the jack of all trades and the master of none. You tend to go wide – for breadth, not depth. You may appear confident, but you can lack self-confidence and inner sureness. You love to talk, both with your mouth as well as your hands.

You meet life with curiosity. Communication will become vital, and you will develop a strong desire for knowledge and expression. You are the seeker on a search for knowledge in any viable form.

Spiritual lesson to learn: Control (learn to control and not scatter energies and to prioritize).

You feel unsuited for menial physical labor and you hate to get your hands dirty. 

Your desire to be liked by everyone may cause you to seek peace at any price, thus you can be evasive on issues due to your desire to keep the peace. You can be quite vacillating and indecisive. You are much more at odds with yourself than people would guess by looking at you from the outside. It is sometimes very difficult for you to make up your mind because you see all sides of any issue and you always want to be fair. You must learn to stand up for your principles.

You, your thoughts, and your ways of communicating tend to be idealistic, psychic, intuitive, imaginative, sympathetic, diplomatic, extremely sensitive, compassionate, and visionary. On the negative side you can be lazy, impractical, day-dreamy, over-sensitive, procrastinating, indifferent and absent-minded. 

You may lack a strong desire to work or to push yourself into doing anything that takes a lot of strength, organization, patience, and responsibility.

Formal book learning may not be your area of strength, yet you can absorb knowledge in the most remarkable ways if you are interested in the subject area. 

You are sensitive to your environment and thus you should be careful of which environments you hang around in. Your nerves and your mental health require you to periodically rest away from the noise of the work-a-day world. Take some time to be alone with yourself to regroup. But not too much time, as you have a tendency to get carried away with yourself and your problems. 

Healing using visualization techniques or healing through the laying on of hands may appeal to you. You may have great interest and talent in art, music, drama or poetry. Your imagination can be quite highly developed. Because you tend to think in terms of mental abstractions, translating your thoughts and impressions into concrete, everyday language may be difficult for you at times and consequently you may appear less intelligent or at least less quick-witted and verbal than others. 

You dislike being pinned down to facts and you follow your instinct rather than logic. You are intuitive and able to sense what others' thoughts and feelings are, even before they say anything to you. Sometimes you get so immersed in your own world of thought and imagination that you overlook things in your immediate, tangible environment. 

You are extremely open-minded and believe that anything is possible. Intangible or spiritual forces seem just as real to you as anything in the concrete world and you often form an opinion about a person or situation without much factual knowledge of them, and your impressions are usually correct. Keeping your mind positively occupied is important, as day-dreaming tends to go off in strange directions.

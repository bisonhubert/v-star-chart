# v-star-chart

This program runs an automation that interacts with a web form for discovering your astrological star chart.

The reason for the automation is my partner did not know her time of birth, which makes it impossible to calculate her star chart. She did know that it was the afternoon, so the automation:

* Fills out the star chart form for every second in a range of time
* Aggregates the results of the form
* Shares definitive results, as well as percentages if multiple results appear (ie: Moon can be in Sagittarius and Scorpio)

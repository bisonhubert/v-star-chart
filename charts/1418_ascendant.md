You can be generous, proud, emotional, romantic, extroverted, vain, egotistical, courageous, sentimental, self-confident, showy, and want to shine and be successful in wherever you go and whatever you do. You like to "rule" and have homage paid to you for your "royal" nature. 

You like to take risks and can sometimes be foolhardy, but you definitely have a zest for living. Life is best viewed as a grand creative project. Your self-expression is powerful, warm, sunny and enthusiastic. You are generous and fun-loving and enjoy being the center of attention.

The worst thing someone can do to you is to hurt your pride or be unappreciative of you. You wear your heart on your sleeve in matters of love and you need a partner you can be proud of â€“ and you want them to be proud of you. 

You are faithful to and protective of those you love. You can be quick-tempered, but you tend to not stay angry for long. You like to play the kingly role and have a sense of drama surrounding you. You are a ham. You like being the center of attention and will do things just to get that attention. 

You can be stubborn in a sunny sort of way. Your roar is worse than your bite. If your pride is hurt or your dignity is trampled on, then watch out, because you can forgive, but you don't forget. You enjoy sports and out-of-doors activity. Your vitality and spirit are strong except if your heart is broken in love. Your need for love and affection is very great and you need to feel appreciated. If frustrated, you lose your desire for living.

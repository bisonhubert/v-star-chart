You yearn to merge and be at-one with your partner. In fact you want to be at-one with the universe. You also enjoy sharing inspirational activities with your partner, ranging from listening to beautiful music to visiting an art gallery.

Your affections are expressed in sympathetic, compassionate, softhearted, romantic ways. You unselfishly give of yourself to those you love or to those who need or ask for your help. You may be a sucker for any sort of sob story and perhaps give too much at times which make some overly dependent on you.

You are very idealistic in matters of love and this sometimes plays itself out whereby you become the martyr or the savior in relationships. You tend to be more compassionate than passionate and you become involved with others because they need love or need to be "saved" and you want to help them rather than out of mutual attraction or pleasure.

You attract and are attracted to those who are sensitive, imaginative, or musically or artistically inclined. Your desire is to find someone you can have a deep, spiritual relationship with.

You idealize love and have a very beautiful, romantic vision of what love can be. At times you can simply be in love with love.

You may be highly emotional, perhaps overly so, sensitive, artistic, compassionate, gentle and psychic. You can be too easy-going or submissive and allow yourself to be taken advantage of because you do not want other people to feel let down and you don't like to make waves. You may have the attitude that somehow you must suffer in love, and do so willingly.

People with Cancer rising tend to be less vital than average, having periods of low energy. They are sympathetic, compassionate, passive, nurturing, receptive, protective, retentive, changeable, psychic, sentimental, tenacious, timid, quiet, sensitive, acquisitive (pack-rat), and moody. 

Just like the crab Cancer represents, you may have the habit of looking ahead and behind you at the same time, not fully wanting to face the future head-on and always worrying about the past and what might be sneaking up on you from behind, causing you great worry. You go through life in a curious sideways motion, never going simply directly forward.

You are sensitive and you retreat into your shell when you feel threatened. You can build a protective wall if you feel vulnerable. Your feelings can be easily hurt even when no slight was meant, and you can take things much too personally. 

You enjoy travel, but you absolutely need to know that you have a home base waiting for you to come back to. Security is everything for you in life. Physical security comes with a comfortable base of operations and emotional security comes from all your possessions and attachments that have sentimental value to you. In fact, that's why you keep everything â€“ because of all the emotional value and significance.

Once you have latched onto something or someone, you do not tend to let go easily. You respond to life through feeling, not thinking. Your moods go up and down just like the tides.

Caring for others provides your key for self-expression. Life can also be met with strong internalized emotions and a tenacious regard for family and tradition.


Spiritual lesson to learn: Discernment (distinguish boundaries).

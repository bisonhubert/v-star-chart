Ascendant in Gemini 

You tend to be friendly, communicative, flexible, indecisive, unsure, liking to do two or more things at once, witty, clever, very active mentally, high-strung, temperamental, nervous or anxious, talkative, superficial, and always ready for something different. 

There may be two distinct sides to you as Gemini represents the Twins. You have a strong need to communicate what you already know and to learn more. You enjoy reading and traveling as they both give plenty of scope for picking up new knowledge. 

You need variety and can be the jack of all trades and the master of none. You tend to go wide â€“ for breadth, not depth. You may appear confident, but you can lack self-confidence and inner sureness. You love to talk, both with your mouth as well as your hands.

You meet life with curiosity. Communication will become vital, and you will develop a strong desire for knowledge and expression. You are the seeker on a search for knowledge in any viable form.


Spiritual lesson to learn: Control (learn to control and not scatter energies and to prioritize).
